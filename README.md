# Vite Hono Bun Template

This template should help get you started developing with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment, this template runs Vite's bundler and a Hono server in parallel.
> In the future, when [this issue](https://github.com/honojs/hono/issues/3293) is resolved, this template will integrate directly with Vite's createServer middleware.

## Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run a development server:

```bash

```

Build and run a production server:

```bash
bun run start
```
